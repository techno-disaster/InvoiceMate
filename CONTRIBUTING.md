> We appreciate all valuable contributions - bug reports, documentation and design enhancements issues as well as pull Requests to make the app more convenient, functional and bug free.

> To begin contributing have a look at the open issues .

> Feel free to open an issue (and work on it too), if you have an idea that would make it better than it already is. However, it would be better to get the thumbs up from a maintainer first because we wouldn't want your work to go in vain.
